## Envelop

`envelop` is a lightweight JavaScript (/TypeScript) library for wrapping GraphQL execution layer and
flow, allowing developers to develop, share and collaborate on GraphQL-related plugins while filling
the missing pieces in GraphQL implementations.

`envelop` aims to extend the GraphQL execution flow by adding plugins that enrich the feature set of
your application.
