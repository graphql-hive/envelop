### Minor Changes

- [#2607](https://github.com/graphql-hive/envelop/pull/2607)
  [`3ebaa3b`](https://github.com/graphql-hive/envelop/commit/3ebaa3b75b34f9a61aa517166f538796b383bfad)
  Thanks [@EmrysMyrddin](https://github.com/EmrysMyrddin)! - Added new `withState` plugin utility
  for easy data sharing between hooks.

  ## New plugin utility to ease data sharing between hooks

  Sometimes, plugins can grow in complexity and need to share data between its hooks.

  A way to solve this can be to mutate the graphql context, but this context is not always available
  in all hooks in Yoga or Hive Gateway plugins. Moreover, mutating the context gives access to your
  internal data to all other plugins and graphql resolvers, without mentioning performance impact on
  field access on this object.

  The recommended approach to this problem was to use a `WeakMap` with a stable key (often the
  `context` or `request` object). While it works, it's not very convenient for plugin developers,
  and is prone to error with the choice of key.

  The new `withState` utility solves this DX issue by providing an easy and straightforward API for
  data sharing between hooks.

  ```ts
  import { withState } from '@envelop/core'

  type State = { foo: string }

  const myPlugin = () =>
    withState<Plugin, State>(() => ({
      onParse({ state }) {
        state.forOperation.foo = 'foo'
      },
      onValidate({ state }) {
        const { foo } = state.forOperation
        console.log('foo', foo)
      }
    }))
  ```

  The `state` payload field will be available in all relevant hooks, making it easy to access shared
  data. It also forces the developer to choose the scope for the data:

  - `forOperation` for a data scoped to GraphQL operation (Envelop, Yoga and Hive Gateway)
  - `forRequest` for a data scoped to HTTP request (Yoga and Hive Gateway)
  - `forSubgraphExecution` for a data scoped to the subgraph execution (Hive Gateway)

  Not all scopes are available in all hooks, the type reflects which scopes are available

  Under the hood, those states are kept in memory using `WeakMap`, which avoid any memory leaks.

  It is also possible to manually retrieve the state with the `getState` function:

  ```ts
  const myPlugin = () =>
    withState(getState => ({
      onParse({ context }) {
        // You can provide a payload, which will dictate which scope you have access to.
        // The scope can contain `context`, `request` and `executionRequest` fields.
        const state = getState({ context })
        // Use the state elsewhere.
      }
    }))
  ```

### Minor Changes

- [#2430](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/pull/2430)
  [`a107c89`](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/commit/a107c896d7a7b1af7417ed0708be336db2ecbb54)
  Thanks [@EmrysMyrddin](https://github.com/EmrysMyrddin)! - ## New `Instruments` API

  Introducation of a new API allowing to instrument the graphql pipeline.

  This new API differs from already existing Hooks by not having access to intup/output of phases.
  The goal of `Instruments` is to run allow running code before, after or araound the **whole
  process of a phase**, incuding plugins hooks executions.

  The main use case of this new API is observability (monitoring, tracing, etc...).

  ### Basic usage

  ```ts
  import { envelop } from '@envelop/core'
  import Sentry from '@sentry/node'

  const getEnveloped = envelop({
    plugins: [
      {
        instruments: {
          execute: ({ context }, wrapped) =>
            Sentry.startSpan({ name: 'Graphql Operation' }, async () => {
              try {
                await wrapped()
              } catch (err) {
                Sentry.captureException(err)
              }
            })
        }
      }
    ]
  })
  ```

  ### Mutliple instruments plugins

  It is possilbe to have multiple instruments plugins (Prometheus and Sentry for example), they will
  be automatically composed by envelop in the same order than the plugin array (first is outtermost,
  last is inner most).

  ```ts
  import { useOpentelemetry } from '@envelop/opentelemetry'
  import { useSentry } from '@envelop/sentry'

  const getEnveloped = envelop({
    plugins: [useSentry(), useOpentelemetry()]
  })
  ```

  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    Sentry->>Opentelemetry: ;
    Opentelemetry->>Envelop: ;
    Envelop->>Opentelemetry: ;
    Opentelemetry->>Sentry: ;
  ```

  ### Custom instruments ordering

  If the default composition ordering doesn't suite your need, you can mannually compose
  instruments. This allows to have a different execution order of hooks and instruments.

  ```ts
  import { useOpentelemetry } from '@envelop/opentelemetry'
  import { composeInstruments, useSentry } from '@envelop/sentry'

  const { instruments: sentryInstruments, ...sentryPlugin } = useSentry()
  const { instruments: otelInstruments, ...otelPlugin } = useOpentelemetry()
  const instruments = composeInstruments([otelInstruments, sentryInstruments])

  const getEnveloped = envelop({
    plugins: [{ instruments }, sentryPlugin, otelPlugin]
  })
  ```

  ```mermaid
  sequenceDiagram
    Opentelemetry->>Sentry: ;
    Sentry->>Envelop: ;
    Envelop->>Sentry: ;
    Sentry->>Opentelemetry: ;
  ```

  Thanks [@EmrysMyrddin](https://github.com/EmrysMyrddin)! - The `addPlugin` function now insert the
  plugin in place in the plugin list, leading to a more predictable execution order.

  **Breaking Change:** This change alter the execution order of plugins. This can break some plugins
  that was relying on the fact the `addPlugin` allowed to push a plugin to the end of the plugin
  list.

  If it is the case, the best fix is to reorder the plugin list and ensure the plugin is in the
  right position, after all its dependencies.

  We have built the new `envelop` to be engine agnostic. `graphql-js` is no longer a peer

  GraphQL Engine.

  [`dc1e24b5`](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/commit/dc1e24b5340ed7eba300a702b17f9be5cff65a8f)
  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - Rename `useLazyLoadedSchema` to
  `useSchemaByContext` since the original name was vert misleading.

  [`dc1e24b5`](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/commit/dc1e24b5340ed7eba300a702b17f9be5cff65a8f)
  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - Remove `enableIf` utility in favor of more type
  safe way to conditionally enable plugins. It wasn't a great experience to have a utility

  We can easily replace usage like this:

  ```diff
  - import { envelop, useMaskedErrors, enableIf } from '@envelop/core'
  + import { envelop, useMaskedErrors } from '@envelop/core'
  import { parse, validate, execute, subscribe } from 'graphql'

  const isProd = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'

  const getEnveloped = envelop({
    parse,
    validate,
    execute,
    subscribe,
    plugins: [
      // This plugin is enabled only in production
  -    enableIf(isProd, useMaskedErrors())
  +    isProd && useMaskedErrors()
    ]
  })
  ```

  [`dc1e24b5`](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/commit/dc1e24b5340ed7eba300a702b17f9be5cff65a8f)
  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - Remove `handleValidationErrors` and
  `handleParseErrors` options from `useMaskedErrors`.

  > ONLY masking validation errors OR ONLY disabling introspection errors does not make sense, as
  > both can be abused for reverse-engineering the GraphQL schema (see
  > https://github.com/nikitastupin/clairvoyance for reverse-engineering the schema based on
  > validation error suggestions). https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/issues/1482#issue-1340015060

  Rename `formatError` function option to `maskError`

- [#1487](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/pull/1487)
  [`dc1e24b5`](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/commit/dc1e24b5340ed7eba300a702b17f9be5cff65a8f)
  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - Removed orchestrator tracing

  `GraphQLSchema` was wrapped to provide resolvers/fields tracing from the schema. Issue with this
  approach was it was very specific to the underlying engine's implementation. With the new version
  we no longer want to depend to a specific implementation. Now users can wrap their schemas and add
  tracing themselves.

### Minor Changes

  [`dc1e24b5`](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/commit/dc1e24b5340ed7eba300a702b17f9be5cff65a8f)
  Thanks [@saihaj](https://github.com/saihaj)! - respond to context, parse and validate errors in
  `useErrorHandler` plugin

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1499](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/pull/1499)
  [`1f7af02b`](https://github.com/n1ru4l/envelop/commit/1f7af02b9f1a16058a6d69fcd48425a93be655c6)
  Thanks [@viniciuspalma](https://github.com/viniciuspalma)! - Adding tslib to package dependencies

  Projects that currently are using yarn Berry with PnP or any strict dependency resolver, that
  requires that all dependencies are specified on package.json otherwise it would endue in an error
  if not treated correct

  Since https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#importHelpers is currently being used, tslib should
  be exported as a dependency to external runners get the proper import.

  Change on each package:

  ```json
  // package.json
  {
    "dependencies": {
      "tslib": "^2.4.0"
    }
  }
  ```

  Thanks [@n1ru4l](https://github.com/n1ru4l)! - Ensure error thrown from the context factory is
  wrapped within a GraphQLError for proper formatting. Previously this caused an unexpected error to
  be swallowed completly when error masking is enabled.

## 2.4.2

### Patch Changes

- 071f946: Fix CommonJS TypeScript resolution with `moduleResolution` `node16` or `nodenext`
- Updated dependencies [071f946]
  - @envelop/types@2.3.1

## 2.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 787d28a2: Use the custom error formatter for the errors thrown when building the context and the
  subscription

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 8bb2738: Support TypeScript module resolution.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [8bb2738]
  - @envelop/types@2.3.0

## 2.3.3

### Patch Changes

- fbf6155: update package.json repository links to point to the new home
- Updated dependencies [fbf6155]
  - @envelop/types@2.2.1

## 2.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 07d029b: use the correct `GraphQLErrorExtensions` interface for the `extensions` constructor
  option on `EnvelopError`.

## 2.3.1

### Patch Changes

- d5c2c9a: fix immediate introspection for subscription and mutation

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- af23408: Pass context to registerContextErrorHandler

  ```ts
  export const useMyHook = (): Plugin => {
    return {
      onPluginInit(context) {
        context.registerContextErrorHandler(({ context }) => {
          console.error(
            'Error occurred during context creation but at least I have the  context so far',
            context
          )
        })
      }
    }
  }
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [af23408]
  - @envelop/types@2.2.0

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- d5115b4: allow masking validation and parse errors with `useMaskedErrors`.

  ```ts
  useMaskedErrors({
    handleParseErrors: true,
    handleValidateErrors: true
  })
  ```

  This option is disabled by default as validation and parse errors are expected errors that help
  the API consumer instead of leaking secret information.

  If you want to avoid leaking schema suggestions, we recommend using persisted operations.

- d5115b4: add `setResult` to `AfterValidateEventPayload` for altering the validation errors.

### Patch Changes

- ada7fb0: correctly identify introspection only operations in `useImmediateIntrospection`
- Updated dependencies [d5115b4]
  - @envelop/types@2.1.0

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 78b3db2: Add `setResultAndStopExecution` to the `onSubscribe` context.

### Patch Changes

- f5eb436: always invoke `onExecutDone` hooks

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- aac65ef: Move `onResolverCalled` from within `OnExecuteHookResult` and `OnSubscribeHookResult` to
  the `Plugin` type.

  ```diff
  import type { Plugin } from "@envelop/core";

  const plugin: Plugin = {
    onExecute() {
  -    return {
  -      onResolverCalled() {}
  -    }
  -  }
  +  },
  +  onResolverCalled() {},
  }
  ```

  We highly recommend avoiding to use any plugins that use `onResolverCalled` within your production
  environment as it has severe impact on the performance of the individual resolver functions within
  your schema.

  The schema resolver functions are now ONLY wrapped if any plugin in your envelop setup uses the
  `onResolverCalled` hook.

  If you need any shared state between `onExecute` and `onResolverCalled` you can share it by
  extending the context object.

  ```ts
  import type { Plugin } from '@envelop/core'

  const sharedStateSymbol = Symbol('sharedState')

  const plugin: Plugin = {
    onExecute({ extendContext }) {
      extendContext({ [sharedStateSymbol]: { value: 1 } })
    },
    onResolverCalled({ context }) {
      const sharedState = context[sharedStateSymbol]
      // logs 1
      console.log(sharedState.value)
    }
  }
  ```

### Minor Changes

- 4106e08: Add new option `breakContextBuilding` to `OnContextBuildingEventPayload`.

  This allows short-circuiting the context building phase. Please use this with care as careless
  usage of it can result in severe errors during the execution phase, as the context might not
  include all the fields your schema resolvers need.

- 4106e08: Add new plugin `useImmediateIntrospection` for speeding up introspection only operations
  by skipping context building.

  ```ts
  import { envelop, useImmediateIntrospection } from '@envelop/core'
  import { schema } from './schema'

  const getEnveloped = envelop({
    plugins: [
      useSchema(schema),
      useImmediateIntrospection()
      // additional plugins
    ]
  })
  ```

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [4106e08]
- Updated dependencies [aac65ef]
  - @envelop/types@2.0.0

## 1.7.1

### Patch Changes

- 3dfddb5: Bump graphql-tools/utils to v8.6.1 to address a bug in getArgumentsValues

## 1.7.0

### Minor Changes

- d9cfb7c: Support including the original error stack for masked errors within the error extensions
  via the `isDev` option and the `defaultErrorFormatter`.

  ```ts
  useMaskedErrors({ isDev: true })
  ```

  On Node.js environments the `isDev` default value is `true` if
  `globalThis.process.env["NODE_ENV"]` is equal to `"development"`. Otherwise, the default value is
  ALWAYS `false`.

  ***

  The `FormatErrorHandler` now has a third argument `isDev` which is forwarded from the
  configuration and can be used for customizing the formatter behavior in development mode.

## 1.6.6

### Patch Changes

- 8e365c2: fix potential memory leak when using `onEnd` and `onNext` stream handlers for hooking
  into `subscribe` and `execute`.

  This has been caused by AsyncGenerators being blocked until the next value is published. Now
  disposed result streams (AsyncIterables) will properly cleanup the underlying stream source.

- fd14339: feat(usePayloadFormatter): add second argument with execution arguments
- 128c5d3: Fix context type inference with enableIf helper

## 1.6.5

### Patch Changes

- d1a0e4e: Allow userland code to specify type of currentContext in ContextFactoryFn

## 1.6.4

### Patch Changes

- d30ef6a: fix issue that caused calculating negative tracing durations

## 1.6.3

### Patch Changes

- 521ecb8: Prefer `globalThis.performance.now` for tracing if available. Fallback to `Date.now`.

  Using tracing no longer raises an error on browser, deno and cloudflare worker environments.

## 1.6.2

### Patch Changes

- f272b28: useTiming: Fix a typo in onSubscriptionMeasurement

## 1.6.1

### Patch Changes

- b1a0331: Properly list `@envelop/core` as a `peerDependency` in plugins.

  This resolves issues where the bundled envelop plugins published to npm had logic inlined from the
  `@envelop/core` package, causing `instanceof` check of `EnvelopError` to fail.

- Updated dependencies [b1a0331]
  - @envelop/types@1.5.1

## 1.6.0

### Minor Changes

- 090cae4: GraphQL v16 support

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [090cae4]
  - @envelop/types@1.5.0

## 1.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 3458917: Allow functions returning a plugin in `enableIf` and lazy load plugin by avoiding running
  the init flow of plugin if value is false.
- 04120de: add support for GraphQL.js 16

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [04120de]
  - @envelop/types@1.4.0

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 365a982: Allow async OnExecuteDone hook

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [365a982]
  - @envelop/types@1.3.0

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- d65e35d: add enableIf utility to enable plugins conditionally
- 26475c9: useErrorHandler: Pass in the execution arguments to the error handler callbacks.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [d65e35d]
- Updated dependencies [26475c9]
  - @envelop/types@1.2.0

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- eb0a4bd: Adds a custom message option used when masking errors

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 7704fc3: Add API for registering a context creation error handler.

  ```ts
  export const useMyHook = (): Plugin => {
    return {
      onPluginInit(context) {
        context.registerContextErrorHandler(({ error, setError }) => {
          console.error('Error occurred during context creation.', error)
          setError(new Error('Something went wrong :('))
        })
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- 7704fc3: `useMaskedErrors` now masks errors thrown during context creation (calling
  `contextFactory`).

  It might be possible that you need to load some data during context creation from a remote source
  that could be unavailable and thus yield in an error being thrown. `useMaskedErrors` now handles
  such scenarios and prevents leaking such information to clients.

  ✅ context error will be masked

  ```ts
  const getEnveloped = envelop({
    plugins: [
      useExtendContext(() => {
        throw new Error('Oooooops.')
      }),
      useMaskedErrors()
    ]
  })
  ```

- 7704fc3: useMaskedErrors now also handles errors that are occurring during subscriptions.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [7704fc3]
  - @envelop/types@1.1.0

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 35c85a7: ensure legacy graphql execute parameters are passed properly.

  ```ts
  // deprecated (removed in GraphQL.js 16)
  execute(schema, ...args)
  // how it should be done
  execute({ schema, ...args })
  ```

  This fixes an edge-case with graphql frameworks that call execute with the old and deprecated
  signature.

  Thus, Envelop allows developers using server frameworks that hard-core the legacy v15 call
  signature to immediately use v16 without waiting for framework developers to adjusting it or
  fork/patch it.

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 452af8f: Update dependencies of graphql-tools to latest

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes
