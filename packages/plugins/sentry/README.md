## `@envelop/sentry`

This plugin collects errors and performance tracing for your execution flow, and reports it to
[Sentry](https://sentry.io).

This is how it looks like in Sentry for error tracking:

> The operation name, document, variables are collected on errors, and the breadcrumbs that led to
> the error. You can also add any custom values that you need.

And for performance tracking:

> You can get information about each resolver (including field and type names), it's execution time
> and arguments. Also, in case of an error, the performance log and info are attached automatically
> to the reported Sentry error.

## Getting Started

```sh
yarn add @sentry/node @sentry/tracing @envelop/sentry
```

1. Start by creating an account and a project in https://sentry.io
2. Follow the instructions to setup your Sentry instance in your application.
3. Setup Sentry global instance configuration.
4. Setup the Envelop plugin.

## Usage Example

```ts
import { execute, parse, specifiedRules, subscribe, validate } from 'graphql'
import { envelop, useEngine } from '@envelop/core'
import { useSentry } from '@envelop/sentry'
// do this only once in you entry file.
import '@sentry/tracing'

const getEnveloped = envelop({
  plugins: [
    useEngine({ parse, validate, specifiedRules, execute, subscribe }),
    // ... other plugins ...
    useSentry({
      includeRawResult: false, // set to `true` in order to include the execution result in the metadata collected
      includeResolverArgs: false, // set to `true` in order to include the args passed to resolvers
      includeExecuteVariables: false, // set to `true` in order to include the operation variables values
      appendTags: args => {}, // if you wish to add custom "tags" to the Sentry transaction created per operation
      configureScope: (args, scope) => {}, // if you wish to modify the Sentry scope
      skip: executionArgs => {} // if you wish to modify the skip specific operations
    })
  ]
})
```

### Configuration

- `forceTransaction` (default: `true`) - Force the creation of a new transaction for every GraphQL
  Operation. By default, Sentry mange the creation of transactions automatically. By enabling this
  option, you can ensure that the GraphQL execution pipeline is always wrapped in its own
  transaction.

- `renameTransaction` (default: `false`) - Renames Transaction.
- `includeRawResult` (default: `false`) - Adds result of each resolver and operation to Span's data
  (available under "result")
- `includeExecuteVariables` (default: `false`) - Adds operation's variables to a Scope (only in case
  of errors)
- `appendTags` - See example above. Allow you to manipulate the tags reports on the Sentry
  transaction.
- `configureScope` - See example above. Allow you to manipulate the tags reports on the Sentry
  transaction.
- `transactionName` (default: operation name) - Produces a name of Transaction (only when
  "renameTransaction" or "startTransaction" are enabled) and description of created Span.
- `traceparentData` (default: `{}`) - Adds tracing data to be sent to Sentry - this includes
  traceId, parentId and more.
- `operationName` - Produces a "op" (operation) of created Span.
- `skip` (default: none) - Produces a "op" (operation) of created Span.
- `skipError` (default: ignored `GraphQLError`) - Indicates whether or not to skip Sentry exception
  reporting for a given error. By default, this plugin skips all `GraphQLError` errors and does not
  report it to Sentry.
- `eventIdKey` (default: `'sentryEventId'`) - The key in the error's extensions field used to expose
  the generated Sentry event id. Set to `null` to disable.
